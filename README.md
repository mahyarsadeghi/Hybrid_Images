# Hybrid_Images
Hybrid Images- Python Jupyter Notebook- Here is an implementation of hybrid images in python. I used two pictures of a cat and dog to maintain a hybrid image. The documentation can be found inside the notebook, but here is a short summary about it:  Hybrid images are the images that are the summation of a one picture with low frequencies and another image with high frequencies. In order to obtain image with low-frequency, I applied gaussian blurring filter(but instead others can be used as well) To create an image with High frequency, we can subtract the image with low frequency from the image itself. Based on Convolution theory , the convolution of two functions is the multiplication of those in the frequency domain. This is why I used fourier to apply the gaussian kernel on the images.
